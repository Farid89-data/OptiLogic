## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**:
  - Randomly generates sales, ad spend, and promotion data using NumPy.
  - Creates realistic business scenarios with adjustable parameters.

- **Data Analysis with Pandas**:
  - Stores data in a structured DataFrame format.
  - Performs descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.
  - Groups data for comparative analysis (e.g., sales with/without promotions).

- **Data Visualization with Matplotlib**:
  - Scatter plots to analyze relationships (e.g., ad spend vs. sales).
  - Line charts for time-series trends.
  - Bar charts for comparison of averages (e.g., sales during promotions).
